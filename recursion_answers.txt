1.Define and compare recursion and iteration.
recursion: The technique where a procedure (i.e., a function) calls itself with parameters 
incrementally moving toward one of the base cases.
iteration: The technique of utilizing a loop to repeat a process.

2.Name five algorithms that are commonly implemented by recursion.
Fast Exponentiation 
Greatest Common Divisor (Euclidâ€™s Algorithm) 
Fibonacci Numbers 
Rank Search
Height of a Binary Tree 

3.When should you use recursion, and when should you avoid recursion? Give examples for each.
When you should use recursions: When an algorithm can be defined as a combination of sub-results starting with known cases.
When you should avoid recursion: When there is high tendency to repeat calculations, since it 
might introduce performance concerns that outweighs the cost of iterative implementation.

4.Compare the recursive and iterative solutions to the three algorithms from the checkpoint 
(factorial, maximum, and fibonacci). What is similar, and what is different?

What is similar: Setting the base case (error when number < 0)
What is different: Where recursive solutions calls itslef multiple times to reach the goal, 
iteration simply go throughs each data and do the needed calculation. 

5.Given a multi-dimensional collection (such as an array) where the number of dimensions is unknown, 
write a recursive algorithm to count the number of items in the entire collection.

6.A palindrome is a word or phrase whose spelling is the same either direction (e.g., racecar). 
Write a recursive algorithm to determine if a given word or phrase is a palindrome.

7.Google Easter Egg: Google the term "recursion". 
Google will prompt you with "Did you mean: recursion". 
Explain why this behavior exhibits properties of recursion.
