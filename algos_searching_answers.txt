Short Answer

1.What is a real-life scenario that uses linear search?

Going through a photo album from the begining to find a picture you are in.

2.What is a real-life scenario that uses binary search?

Finding a book from a library by the number of the book.
You go the middle rack and see if the book number you are looking 
for is higher or lower and omit the other half. By continuing this
you will be able to find the number. 

3.Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint, 
how many iterations would it take to find the value G using linear search?

4.Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint, 
how many iterations would it take to find the value G using binary search?

5.Given an unsorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you 
choose between linear search and binary search? Explain your reasoning.

I would choose linear search, since binary search will be useless without 
items being sorted. 

6.Given a sorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you choose
between linear search and binary search? Explain your reasoning.

I would choose binary, since binary is more likely to be an efficient way to go through mass 
number of items, as long as it is sorted. 

Programming Assignment:

1.You and a friend have set a wager to see who can find the 
word "Albatross" in the dictionary the fastest. Write a program to allow you to win the bet.

Written in Javascript

var binarySearch = function(array, value) {
    var guess,
        min = 0,
        max = array.length - 1;	

    while(min <= max){
        guess = Math.floor((min + max) /2);
	if(array[guess] === value)
	    return guess;
	else if(array[guess] < value)
	    min = guess + 1;
	else
	    max = guess - 1;	
     }
	
     return -1;
}

binarySearch(dictionary, "Albatross")

2.You work at a pet store, and a child has asked you to net 
the only white-spotted goldfish from the fish tank. Write a 
program that will help you net the right fish.

Written in Javascript

 var linearSearch = function(collection, target) {
   var result = null, value;
   for(var i = 0; i < collection.length; i++) {
     value = collection[i];
     if(value === target){
       result = i;
       break;
     }
   }
   return result;
 };

 linearSearch(fishtank, "white-spotted goldfish")
