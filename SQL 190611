3. Given this dogs table, write queries to select the following pieces of data:

Intake teams typically guess the breed of shelter dogs, so the breed column may have multiple words (for example, "Labrador Collie mix").

Display the name, gender, and age of all dogs that are part Labrador.

A. 
SELECT name, gender, age
FROM dogs
WHERE breed LIKE '%labrador%';

Display the ids of all dogs that are under 1 year old.

A.
SELECT id
FROM dogs
WHERE age < 1;

Display the name and age of all dogs that are female and over 35lbs.

A.
SELECT name, age 
FROM dogs
WHERE gender = f AND weight > 35;

Display all of the information about all dogs that are not Shepherd mixes.

SELECT id, name, gender, age, weight, breed, intake_date, in_foster
FROM dogs
WHERE breed NOT LIKE '%shephered%';

Display the id, age, weight, and breed of all dogs that are either over 60lbs or Great Danes.

SELECT id, name, gender, age, intake_date, adoption_date
FROM cats;

Display the name and sex of all cats who are 7 years old.

SELECT name
FROM cats;

6. List each comparison operator and explain when you would use it. Include a real world example for each.
If you can’t list these from memory, do these flashcards until you can!

=    : when you need to specify a reference particulary such as gender, nationality etc.
>    : when you want to specify a number greater than a reference such as age.
<    : when you want to specify a number smaller than a refernce, such as points. 
>=   : when you want to specify a number equal and greater than a reference, such as percentage. 
=<   : when you want to specify a number equal and smaller than a reference, such as prices. 
!=   : when you want to specify a reference you do not want to include, such as names etc.
