1.Using proper pseudo-code, describe the following primitive algorithms:

Making coffee;

FUNCTION makingCoffee(coffeeCup)
    WHILE coffeeCup = empty
        CALL startCoffeemachine with coffeebeans 
    END WHILE
END FUNCTION

Washing dishes;

FUNCTION washingDishes(dishes)
    WHILE dishes are dirty
        CALL washDishes 
    END WHILE
END FUNCTION

Brushing teeth;

FUNCTION brushTeath(teath)
    FOR all teath
        CALL brushTeath
    FOR END
END FUNCTION

1. Boolean (Binary)  created by Gearge Boole
This algorithm is widely recognized as the 
foundation of modern computer coding - 
It is still in use today especially in computer circuitry.

2. QR created by John G. F. Francis
Its basic function is to perform QR decomposition, 
writing the matrix as a product of an orthogonal matrix 
and an upper triangular matrix, and multiplying the 
factors in the reverse order, and iterating.

3.JPEG and Other Data Compression Algorithms by Joint Photographic Experts Group
They have become so widespread today that they are used 
whenever you download a file to your computer, 
play music or video games, stream videos, use a database
 or engage with The Cloud.

A good algorithms against a bad one, is efficient that it accomplishes a goal
faster. Also it is also important that it is easy to understand, which improves maintainablity 
and expandability.
