1.Using proper pseudo-code, describe the following primitive algorithms:

Making coffee;

INIT cofee machine;
Add coffee beans to coffee maker;
Add water to coffee machine; 
Start coffee machine;
Pour coffee to cup;

Washing dishes;

Init new dish;
Add detergent to new dish;
Scrub new dish;
Rinse new dish;
Dry new dish;

Brushing teeth;

Init tooth brush;
Add tooth paste to tooth brush;
Scrup teeth with tooth brush;
Rinse mounth and tooth brush;

2. 
1. Boolean (Binary) 
This algorithm is widely recognized as the 
foundation of modern computer coding - 
It is still in use today especially in computer circuitry.

2. QR
Its basic function is to perform QR decomposition, 
writing the matrix as a product of an orthogonal matrix 
and an upper triangular matrix, and multiplying the 
factors in the reverse order, and iterating.

3.JPEG and Other Data Compression Algorithms
They have become so widespread today that they are used 
whenever you download a file to your computer, 
play music or video games, stream videos, use a database
 or engage with The Cloud. 

3. 
A good algorithms against a bad one, is lean that it accomplishes a goal
with less processing, also easy to understand, which improves maintainablity 
and expandability.
