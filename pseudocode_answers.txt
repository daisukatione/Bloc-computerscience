Short Answer
1.Why do programmers use pseudocode?
A. To express what code should do without using a particular language's syntax. 


2.If you run pseudocode on your computer what would happen?
A. The computer will not be able to interpret the pseudocode.

Programming Assignment
Write the following algorithms in pseudocode:

1.Create a function that takes two numbers and prints out the greater number.
A. 
INPUT first number 
INPUT second number
IF 
the first number is greater than the second number, return the first number. 
ELSE
return the second number

2.Create a function that prints out the numbers from 1 to 100.
INIT total to 0
INPUT ï¼‘
WHILE the number is not 100
  ADD 1 to total
  INPUT 1
END WHILE
RETURN total

3.Create a function that searches for a specific entry in a phonebook.
INIT inputentry to a given entryname 
BROWSE through phonebook
IF the inputentry is equal to the entryofphonebook, return the phonebookpage 

4.Using the pseudocode you wrote for the previous question, implement it in any computer language of your choice.

Java Script

const phonebook = ["Daisuke Goh", "Travis Blair"];

const inputentry = "Daisuke Goh"
const searchresult
FOR through phonebook and if array key is equal to inputentry return key
